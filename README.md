# What is Chip-8?
Chip-8 is an interpreted language, i.e. it's running in a so-called virtual machine, as opposed to compiled languages such as C.<br> Simple games such as Tetris and Pong have been implemented, and actually are available in **public domain**!<br> A kind man has gone ahead and compiled all of these (Thanks!!) : https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/
